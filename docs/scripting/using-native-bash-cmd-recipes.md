# Using native recipes (bash and batch)

**Native recipes** make use of [ShellJS](https://github.com/shelljs/shelljs) to allow the use of Unix shell commands and native OS commands from the same environment.

## Platforms

This single interpreter replaces individual interpreters for both **Unix bash** and **Windows batch (cmd)** scripts.

It is supported on Windows, Linux and OS X.
